Amped for Health Potions
========================

A game made for Ludum Dare 27.

Theme:
======
10 seconds compo

My Idea:
========

A rogue-like semi-RPG that is quick to play because...
You have only 10 seconds worth of health! Gobble health potions,
collect loot to sell to buy more health potions and just generally
try to survive as you look for a way to cure yourself. All while you
are facing against monsters, and doing quests, and stuff. :P

Controls:
=========

 - Arrow keys: movement
 - Hit enemies: bump into them.
 - Stores: run into doors*.
 
* The game pauses while you are in a store or in a menu.
